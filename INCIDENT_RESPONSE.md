## Incident Response Plan

This document outlines the incident response plan for the KSRCE AI Lab Management Platform. The purpose of this plan is to provide a clear and actionable set of procedures to follow in the event of a security incident, data breach, or other emergency.

### 1. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **Incident Commander**: The person responsible for leading the incident response effort.
-   **Technical Lead**: The person responsible for the technical aspects of the response, such as identifying the cause of the incident and implementing a fix.
-   **Communications Lead**: The person responsible for communicating with stakeholders, including users, customers, and the public.

### 2. Incident Response Phases

Our incident response process is divided into four phases:

#### Preparation

-   **Training**: All members of the incident response team are trained on the incident response plan.
-   **Tools**: We have a set of tools in place to help us detect and respond to incidents, including logging and monitoring systems, security scanning tools, and communication channels.

#### Detection and Analysis

-   **Monitoring**: We continuously monitor our systems for signs of an incident.
-   **Alerting**: We have automated alerts in place to notify the incident response team when a potential incident is detected.
-   **Analysis**: Once an incident is detected, we analyze it to determine its scope and severity.

#### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

-   **Containment**: We take immediate steps to contain the incident and prevent it from spreading.
-   **Eradication**: We identify and remove the root cause of the incident.
-   **Recovery**: We restore our systems to a normal, secure state.

#### Post-Incident Activity

-   **Post-Mortem**: After the incident is resolved, we conduct a post-mortem to identify what went well, what went wrong, and what we can do to improve our response in the future.
-   **Documentation**: We document the incident and our response to it.

### 3. Communication Plan

In the event of an incident that affects our users, we will communicate with them in a timely and transparent manner. Our communication plan includes:

-   **Initial Notification**: We will notify users as soon as we have confirmed that an incident has occurred.
-   **Regular Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress in resolving the incident.
-   **Final Report**: Once the incident is resolved, we will provide a final report that explains what happened and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again.

By following this incident response plan, we can effectively respond to security incidents and minimize their impact on our users and our business.

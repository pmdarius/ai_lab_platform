## API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

I have successfully integrated Swagger/OpenAPI documentation into the Django backend. This provides a live, interactive API documentation that developers can use to understand and test the API endpoints.

### How to Access the API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at the following URLs:

- **Swagger UI**: `http://<your_domain>/swagger/`
- **ReDoc**: `http://<your_domain>/redoc/`

These interfaces provide a detailed overview of all available API endpoints, including:

- Request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- URL paths
- Request and response models
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests and responses

This is a critical tool for frontend developers and anyone who needs to interact with the API.
